The Henar#3 is a project of Un Instrumento Para Henar in which Autofabricantes collaborates actively.

The Henar#3 is a custom MIDI Instrument, kind of a Big MIDI Drum machine but modular, cheap, beautiful and adaptable to fit specific necessities.

THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. but hey! we already have the prototype and it is very cool!
