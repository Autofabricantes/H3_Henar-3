Hi! Welcome to the **_Henar#3 Wiki_**, please read carefully this welcome page that describes the full content of the _Wiki_.

# Project Scope
The **_Henar#3_** is a _Open Source_ MIDI percurssion instrument designed to perform live. Its main characteristics are:
* **Open Source:** The **_Henar#3_** has been designed and build with **_Open Source_** HW and SW and using accesible manufacturing technologies in order for it to be very affordable and easily moded.
* **Build Flexibility:** The **_Henar#3_** has been designed to allow a large number of different configurations (HMI elements in order to cope with the specific neccessities of each user.
* **Stand Alone:** The **_Henar#3_** is an instrument designed to be played live, therefore it is a _Plug&Play_ device which does not need of extra elements to be played.
* **Pheriperic Flexibility:** Besides being a _Plug&Play_ device, the **_Henar#3_** allows its connection with other sound devices such as speakers and alternative MIDI devices.

# History and Collaborators
The **_Henar#3_** is part of a longer project started by the **_Celeo Proyectos_** and **_Un Instrumento para Henar_** in 2015. Its initial objective is to build a proper adapted instrument for Henar, a woman from Cuenca (Spain) that plays in an orchestra.

Apart from the instrument (which has two previous versions which will be described later) the project aims to build up a platform for the community of developpers, users and enthusiasts to work toguether towards new ways to socialize with music and make it accesible for everyone. This is achieved not only though the development of the instrument itself but also through the creation of didactic materials and the organization of events such as **_DiverS+S 2017_** (http://www.diversos.eu/), where various projects were presented and put in common, in order to create links and an active net.

The collaborators of this project are:
## Celeo Proyectos

## Un instrumento para Henar

## Autofabricantes
**_Autofabricantes_** in an association based in _Medialab-Prado_, Madrid. It develops several _Open Source_ technological solutions in the medical and accesibility field. It's main development lines right now are:
* Myoelectric Hand Prothesis for children.
* 3D printed hand prosthesis for children (both experimental like __SuperGizz__ and standard).
* **_Henar#3_** instrument (The one this Wiki covers).

# About the previous Henar (Henar#1, Henar#2)
The Un instrumento para Henar project has already developped two previous versions of the instruments.

## Henar#1: [HERE LINK]
## Henar#2: [HERE LINK]

The **_Henar#3_**improvement objetives are:
* Increase System flexibility.
* Easier Assembly and manufacturing.
* Easier MIDI configuration.
* Improved ergonomy.

# Scope of the Wiki
This _Wiki_ aims to concentrate all the knowledge of the project. This covers:
* Global description of the project and its subsystems.
* Description of all the files in the repository.
* Description of all the elements and their evolution.
* **Assembly Guide** of all the elements (HW, SW, Mechanical).
* Tutorials and other didactic material.
